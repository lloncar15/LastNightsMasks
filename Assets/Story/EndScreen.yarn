Well… look at you.
You found them all.
A heart, a hat, a mushroom, and an egg.
Funny what counts as “keys” around here.
That means you are free to go.
Back home.
Maybe even throw your own little party.
…Actually
You don’t really need a key to leave. You never did.
Because you are the key.
Wait. Before you go.
Who exactly are you?
//Camera slowly turns 180°
Oh.
//Bebe (off-screen): Hey… have you seen my rabbit?
Guess you were home the whole time.
A home that lives inside you.
